# Algorithms-class
Contains the work I did for my algorithms class in college, split into 4 assignments

Closest pair: the objective was, given a x,y grid, find the smallest distance between 2 points while completing it without comparing every point to every other , so smaller than O(n^2) time.

Assignment 5: the objective was, given a x,y grid with values at each point, find the length of the largest path in the grid. The largest path being defined as the set of connected edges from larger values to lower values. An edge could only be part of the path if the start value is higher than the end value.

Assignment 10: The objective was, given a x,y grid (a pixel grid) with some pixels colored and others not, attempt to cover every colored pixel with a 2x1 tile. The 2x1 tile could not cover a noncolored tile. If it was not possible, then the algorithm would return the string "impossible". If it was possible, the algorithm would return the start and end coordinates of every 2x1 tile needed to cover the colored pixels.

Exam attempt: From exam, the idea being people at a party. People had one feature, the others that they knew. Implemented an algorithm to find the "celebrity", the person who knew nobody but who everyone knew.
